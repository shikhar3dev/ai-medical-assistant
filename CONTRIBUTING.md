# Contributing to Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-disease-prediction.git
   cd ai-disease-prediction
   ```
3. **Create a branch** for your feature:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Setup

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -e .  # Install in editable mode
   ```

2. **Install development dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install pytest pytest-cov black flake8 mypy
   ```

3. **Run tests** to ensure everything works:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/ -v
   ```

## Code Style

We follow PEP 8 style guidelines with some modifications:

- **Line length**: 100 characters maximum
- **Formatting**: Use `black` for automatic formatting
- **Linting**: Use `flake8` for linting
- **Type hints**: Use type hints where possible

### Format your code:
```bash
black .
flake8 .
mypy .
```

## Making Changes

### 1. Write Clean Code

- Follow existing code patterns
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Use meaningful variable names
- Keep functions focused and small

### 2. Add Tests

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass: `pytest tests/ -v`
- Aim for >80% code coverage

### 3. Update Documentation

- Update README.md if needed
- Add docstrings to new functions
- Update CHANGELOG.md

### 4. Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
feat: Add SHAP waterfall plot visualization
fix: Resolve gradient clipping bug in DP trainer
docs: Update installation instructions
test: Add tests for LIME explainer
refactor: Simplify data partitioning logic
```

Prefixes:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `test`: Test additions/changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update your branch** with the latest main:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. **Run all tests**:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/ -v --cov
   ```

3. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Reference to related issues
   - Screenshots (if UI changes)
   - Test results

5. **Address review comments** promptly
