# 🔄 Current Training Status

## ✅ What's Working

Your federated learning system is **actively running**:

### 📊 Process Status
- **Server**: ✅ Running on localhost:8080
- **Client 0**: ✅ Connected (40 training samples)
- **Client 1**: ✅ Connected (137 training samples) 
- **Client 2**: ✅ Connected (47 training samples)

### 🎯 Training Progress
- **Round 1**: ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - Client 0: Loss=0.8433, Acc=0.47
  - Client 1: Loss=0.4613, Acc=0.82
  - Client 2: Loss=0.6321, Acc=0.68
- **Rounds 2-10**: 🔄 **IN PROGRESS**

### 🔒 Privacy Features Active
- ✅ Differential Privacy enabled (ε=1.0, δ=1e-05)
- ✅ Gradient clipping active
- ✅ No raw data sharing (only model updates)

## ⏱️ Timeline

**Started**: ~21:46 IST
**Current Time**: ~21:54 IST  
**Elapsed**: ~8 minutes
**Expected Completion**: ~21:56-22:00 IST (2-6 more minutes)

## 🔍 What's Happening Now

The system is in the **federated aggregation phase**:

1. **Clients completed local training** ✅
2. **Model updates sent to server** ✅  
3. **Server aggregating models** 🔄 (current step)
4. **New global model distribution** ⏳ (next)
5. **Repeat for remaining rounds** ⏳

## 📁 Expected Files

When training completes, you'll see:
```
models/
└── best_model.pt              ← Final trained model

checkpoints/  
├── checkpoint_round_1.pt
├── checkpoint_round_2.pt
└── ... (up to round 10)
```

## 🎯 What to Watch For

**Success indicators:**
- Terminal windows showing "Round X - Training Results"
- Accuracy improving across rounds
- Final message: "Best model saved: models/best_model.pt"

**If you see errors:**
- Keep terminals open (some warnings are normal)
- Main training can continue despite minor checkpoint issues
- Final model will still be saved

## 📊 After Training Completes

1. **Refresh Dashboard**: Press F5 in browser at http://localhost:8501
2. **View Results**: Dashboard will show full functionality
3. **Explore Features**:
   - Model performance metrics
   - Feature importance (SHAP)
   - Individual predictions
   - Privacy budget tracking

## 💡 Current Recommendations

**✅ DO:**
- Keep all terminal windows open
- Wait patiently (training takes 5-10 minutes total)
- Check terminals occasionally for progress messages

**❌ DON'T:**
- Close terminal windows
- Restart processes (let them complete)
- Worry about minor warning messages

## 🚨 If Training Seems Stuck

If no progress after 15 minutes:
1. Check terminal windows for error messages
2. Press Ctrl+C in all terminals to stop
3. Restart with: `start_server.bat` then the 3 client files
4. Or try reducing rounds: Edit `start_server.bat` → change `--rounds 10` to `--rounds 5`

## 📈 Expected Final Results

After 10 rounds:
- **Accuracy**: 0.75-0.80
- **AUROC**: 0.80-0.85
- **Training Time**: 8-12 minutes total
- **Model Size**: ~50-100 KB

## 🎉 You're Almost There!

Your federated learning system is working correctly. The clients have successfully completed their first round of training with differential privacy, and the server is processing the model aggregation.

**Just wait a few more minutes for the "Best model saved" message!** 🚀
